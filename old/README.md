# Implementing Feature Flags in Next.js with ConfigCat
This is a companion sample application for the [**Implementing Feature Flags in Next.js with ConfigCat**](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/04/22/how-to-use-feature-flags-in-nextjs/) article.

This sample app is an implemention of a new feature in a Next.js application that enables you generate a random user profiles with every page load or reload.
The feature is then connected to a feature flag to give us the control needed to plan a feature release to our users.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
